MC capstone project for Data Science---Analyzing the Effectiveness of Montgomery County, Maryland's Vision Zero Traffic Safety Project.

The final analysis of the project is in the word document file, while the final presentation is in the powerpoint.  Those two documents are drawn from the analyses in the various notebooks.  

I have included a geo_environment yml file for use with geopandas, but I ended up using tableau rather than geopandas for more interactive maps.

The fbprophet environment is necessary for using the statistical analysis notebook.  (I determined fbprophet could not run on python 3.8, so built a new environment on python 3.7.)

The MoCoDetails csv referenced in the code is simply a merge of the three csv files (crash_reporting) uploaded here.  I could not upload other csv files because they were too large.  The link to the datasets is in the code in the notebooks (and in the citations under the plots in the final report.)
